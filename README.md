## 1. Introduction

With the rise of the rogue-like genre, with the growing understanding by more casual gamers that smaller feedback loops actually have high compatibility with busier schedules and lives and more non-commital gamers, it's difficult to innovate longer form games that can keep the player engaged long term. 

I discuss more about how games tackle this here: https://github.com/JonahWeaver/Arsenic/blob/main/README.md#41-how-games-tackle-long-form-gameplay

To circumvent this with standard gameplay designs, various difficulties will be available, and all "crossroads" the player can traverse will be available at some point. A focus on high "transferring" between elements of the gameplay loop will be employed, along with highly compartmentalized goals for the player to accomplish such that they can feel a sense of accomplishment in the smaller part of the game to carry them throughout the larger part.

## 4. Rambling
Below is where I ramble about the specifics of reasonings of certain design choices among other observations. While relevant to the "why" of certain decisions, it's not necessary for the direction of the project.

### 4.1 How games tackle long form gameplay
Persona 5 performs this with a simple gameplay loop and compelling characters, narrative, and overall artstyle. 

Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom performs this through its dynamic feedback loop and gameplay system, along with "goal setting". By this, the game accomplishes engagement by presenting the player with many interesting challenges that each have their own immediate reward that's quantifiable to the player. This allows the player to direct simple goals into a satisfying gameplay loop. For example, the game has a total of 120 shrines, which are a significant part of the its progression. The player compartmentalizes these simply as shrines, but this isn't all that they are. They are a portal to a test of skill to the player to collect various rewards along with an orb at the end, which is necessary to increasing certain stats. These stats are health and stamina, which allow for better navigation of the world and improved tanking abilities for combat and other navigation.

Why do I call all of the above "goal setting"? Because, for a normal player, not all of this can be accomplished in one sitting. This should be obvious, but this can create a "nagging" in the player's mind that can return them to the game. Perhaps like "I remember seeing a few shrines in a place. If I can get those I can explore an area I haven't been to yet and maybe acquire something". Always keeping alive that "black box" to the player while making discovering it rewarding both gameplay wise and personally is a great.

Elden Ring accomplishes this in a similar way, but much more focused to certain areas. Elden Ring's currency allowing any creature to give the player currency and loot upon death can naturally allow them to fell intrigue in approaching even dangerous places. A brilliant example of this is the combination of the game's opening along with the "Scarlet Bog". he game's opening highlights the danger of the world along with an instinct by the player to desire staying alive. This is highlighted by if the player sees the Scarlet Bog early on, they aren't limited by an arbitrary wall preventing them from entering the area like other games. They're prevented by their own caution and lack of experience to traverse a clearly dangerous area, and are more likely to respect the developers' "intended" path. This counter-intuitively builds player confidence, as they're not just tackling enemies. They're trusting their understanding of their setting to make decisions, which can allow them to ask questions about this world around them.

To build on this, Elden Ring has a great balance between leveraging narrative elements of the world and its characters and the dangers it presents and the player's goals in its core loops. Elden Ring's loops are not explicit; you can be attacked by an enemy at technically any point in the game. This is a very subtle design choice that adds to the feeling of danger in any interaction. It might be the player's perogative to attack enemies ahead of time; trust no one. But maybe the player encounters someone who wasn't aggressing now making their lives difficult becuase they're so strong? Or maybe the player wouldn't want to risk it in the first place. Regardless, building this caution asks the player to listen to everything a potential aggressor might say, which portrays the world of the game as one interconnected between the NPCs and what they represent. It's no longer just "this big enemy" or another. It's "Godrick the Golden" who is the last of his lineage who disgraced it by utilizing the world's practice of "grafting" to attain strength that is nowhere near that of even stronger enemies later in the game. This is all organically built up by the player's own observations of the enemies, world, and characters around them. 

While the above sounds more like strong adherence to the fundamentals of world building - which is correct- it's also the stepping stone for the player to engage with the world around them. No game mentioned in this excerpt has had one single gameplay mechanic that crafted the image of the game in the player's head to continue going forward. Persona 5 has its monster-catching system along with its narrative. Tears of the Kingdom has its colorful world and the challenges to acquire resources to explore it and defend against it. The SoulsBorne games developed by FromSoft have always had a key theme in these games, and its the idea that no matter the setting, the player slowly becomes nothing but a pawn to success in the game. This is communicated directly in Dark Souls, where the player loses humanity as they die. While the character can restore this, it's implied throughout the story that there is still "something" lost as the player moves forward. The player, no matter who they must kill or hurt, will still move forward until they win. The challenge of the game no longer becomes a triumph, but a test to the player of how far they're willing to go. Of course, the player is not less moral for what they have to do, but this slowly dying consideration of the world around them - optimizing this understanding only for the accomplishment of the player's goals- is expertly utilized by the developers to not just present mind-boggling enemy design that force the player to stop and consider what they're doing, but also morally questionable ones. A great example is Elden Ring's (lady of the moon or whatever. I've got to stop writing here because I don't want to waste time.)

How do we implement these and similar ideas into a larger tactics game? It feels simply as though building small and rewarding feedback loops that can organically be chosen by the player is the immediate "correct solution". How is this formed organically by the player? How do we prevent risking them formulating on their decision for too long and not ultimately allowing them to reward themselves?

* Difficulty levels can be used to better tailor the player experience. This might require questioning how this can be integrated into a system that bypasses alot of redesign work between difficulties, but this can be considered later.
* "Crossroads should be retraversable". In rogue-likes, there are often decisions that allow the player to trend decisions towards a "build". Say you can only choose 1 of 3 pieces of equipment that boosts bow damage by a percent. Ideally, you'd continually choose the "bow" choice until the run ends. Since the game has a short run, there isn't much consequence to the bow being bad if it is; the player can just restart and not much isn't lost. This is a bad idea for a long form game. If the player doesn't like their choice for their style of play, they were just completely unrewarded for them playing the game.
* Gameplay loops feed into each other
  * The easiest way of doing this is allowing for, in some way, to allow the parts of a loop to provide currencies in another part of a loop. Like how in Civ 5 settling or city conquering can provide resources for further development, or maybe how some currencies can allow for more development in others. The risk in this is creating a system that has may too many currencies and rules can drive away most players who might have difficulty in having fun doing math and science (Stellaris). This can be circumvented by only allowing certain resources to be relevant as the game progresses, allowing the player to learn that the game does have resources relevant to the gameplay loop that have compartmentalized functions.
  * The only other way of feeding loops into each other are logical loops, but that's likely pretty similar. As in, if the player makes certain decisions, it creates "roadblocks" that prevent certain events, which can pertain to multiple loops at once. This is highly specific to each loop and might require specific design dicsussion on its own, if it's even different enough from the currency idea.
* Compartmentalized goals with quantifiably significant reward
  * Like hearts/stamina in TOTK or palace/Tartarus completion in Persona 5, something larger scale that the player can break down easily into goals allows the gameplay loop
  * Bosses
    * Bosses are what I was trying to describe with the Elden Ring thing. Story significant characters or creatures that are built up both narratively and gameplay wise to highlight challenge to the player are a great goal for players to set to defeat.
    * Reward?
  * Forts/Strongholds
    * Similar to bosses in that this is CAN be a quantifiable goal that the player can conquer strongholds to recapture the country or something. This can allow for significant gains to resources or other things to acquire in this or other gameplay loops. Whether this should be different or intermingled with "bosses" is ?
    * Reward? 
  * Other positions?
    * What if "Strongholds" aren't the only major areas to conquer. This might become confusing then. While it might be fun to have multiple different areas for the player to conquer for differing rewards, TOTK doesn't have things like "Green shrines" or "Purple shrines". It might be best to keep things simple while also using a word that accurately describes all of these important positions.
